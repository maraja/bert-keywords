                     'Development of physical prowess  skill  and mental processes continues for many years ',
                     'Even middle age does not interrupt development ',
                     'Inevitably a process of involution begins ',
                     'Like growth in earlier years  it affects different tissues and structures at different rates  slowed at first by the replacement of declining functions with newfound skills and bionic parts ',
                     'Ultimately  however  change ceaseslife ceases ',
                     'And so it is that no two patients with the same diagnosis have the same disease ',
                     'Their problem formulations will be different  and their appropriate managements cannot be the same ',
                     'Edematous extremities can be painful ',
                     'They are prone to stasis induced ulceration and infection  and occasionally eczematous dermatitis develops ',
                     'When the patient is supine  mobilization of interstitial fluid from the legs leads to paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea and nocturia ',
                     'The sequelae of edema thus obligate the physician to reduce it with diuretics and  if possible  with therapies specific for underlying conditions ',
                     'Skill and continued surveillance are often required to achieve this objective while maintaining adequate arterial perfusion ',
                     'Occasionally  these goals are mutually incompatible ',
                     'There are at least two reasons why every case of edema must be satisfactorily explained ',
                     'Some edema forming disorders  such as constrictive pericarditis  thyrotoxicosis  and beriberi  are curable ',
                     'For others  such as congestive heart failure  nephrotic syndrome  and cirrhosis  appropriate treatment greatly reduces morbidity  and it may succeed in mobilizing edema resistant to diuretics alone ',
                     'In almost all cases of peripheral edema  a complete  thoughtfully integrated database permits accurate identification of the cause  and the correct diagnosis dictates appropriate therapy ',
                     'Several questions can help the examiner accurately localize the weak eye muscle in a patient who complains of double vision ',
                     'The first question functionally differentiates whether the paretic muscle acts predominantly in a horizontal or vertical plane  Are the two images side by side or on top of each other ',
                     'A side by side separation betrays the presence of lateral or medial rectus dysfunction  while vertical diplopia implicates a vertically acting eye muscle ',
                     'Second  determine whether double vision is worse in gaze to the right  left  up  or down ',
                     'A horizontal separation of images that becomes worse in left gaze implies paresis either of the left lateral rectus or right medial rectus muscle  since double vision is always worse in the field of action of the weakened muscle ',
                     'Third  ask whether double vision is worse at near or distance ',
                     'Horizontal diplopia  worse in left gaze and with distance fixation  suggests limitation of left lateral rectus movement ',
                     'If the horizontal diplopia had been worse at near e g   while reading  the right medial rectus would be culpable since a near vision task like reading requires convergence and active medial rectus contraction ',
                     'A vertical separation of images at near  down  and to the right suggests left superior oblique paresis ',
                     'By meticulous history taking and by asking just the few pertinent questions related to the disposition of double images in various positions of gaze  the examiner can gain a wealth of information before the actual evaluation of eye movements ',
                     "Furthermore  observe the position of the patient's head  face  and chin  since many forms of diplopia may be totally eliminated by a compensatory head posture ",
                     'If the right lateral rectus is paralyzed  turning the head to the right produces lateral rotation of the eyes to the left when ocular fixation is maintained ',
                     'Since the right eye is taken out of the field of action of the paretic right lateral rectus muscle  single vision is achieved ',
                     'Face turning to the right or left helps reduce horizontal separation of images ',
                     'Face rotation up or down is used to correct vertical separation of images ',
                     'The patient rotates the face in the direction of the maximum pull of the muscle  so the eyes deviate in the opposite direction and are therefore out of the field of action of the paretic muscle ',
                     'Thus  in right superior rectus palsy the superior rectus acts primarily to elevate the eye in abduction  the face turns up and to the right ',
                     'This throws the eyes to a relatively down and to the left position  away from the field of action of the right superior rectus ',
                     'Head tilting lessens the torsional component of diplopia ',
                     'Superior oblique muscle weakness  for instance  produces diplopia with two images separated vertically ',
                     'The false image will also be angulated ',
                     'Because the superior oblique is a strong intorter  muscle weakness will cause the affected eye to be relatively extorted  thus  the projected image from that eye is intorted relative to the image of the opposite eye ',
                     'If a patient with a weak right superior oblique muscle looks at a straight horizontal line  the false image from the right eye is not only below the true image but is also bent  right side tilted up ',
                     'To correct the vertical separation of images  the patient rotates the face downward  and to correct the torsional component the patient tilts the head to the left shoulder ',
                     'This evokes right eye extorsion  a movement not dependent on the right superior oblique ',
                     'Such patients will enter the office with their heads tilted away from the weakened superior oblique  a sign that has strong localizing value in the evaluation of vertical diplopia ',
                     'Monocular diplopia is never related to a neurologic disturbance of ocular motility ',
                     'The examiner should look for early cataractous changes  corneal opacities  severe astigmatic errors  or dislocation of the lens ',
                     'It is usually described on a psychogenic basis when no cause can be determined ',
                     'Because cerebrovascular disorders are a diverse group of illnesses that are managed in very different ways  an accurate diagnosis is critical ',
                     'The following points are important for proper diagnosis and management ']
